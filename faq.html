                                It depends on many things: project scope, time spent on the project and technological issues. We know it sounds vague but its simply honest.
                                Remember that each software project is different, especially if you had a particularly original idea.
                                We do not want to give you an unrealistic estimate, instead we want to provide you with the best quality possible within your budget.

                                We'll be happy to outline project specification, prepare wireframes, details concerning integrations with external services, API documentation, required features list.
                                 In terms of project development we prepare server-side architecture, front end, back end, graphic and UX design, and create back-office consoles.
                                We are also happy to advise our customers in terms of budgeting, scheduling, risk management, and business model creation.

                                Both have their benefits and flaws. Mobile apps are surely more expensive but can provide you with many more 
                                data collecting, monetisation capabilities than web applications. Progressive Web Apps are a good compromise
                                between a mobile and web app . But remember that sooner or later you may need both mobile and web app and when
                                that moment comes we are here for you :)

                                To give you a precise answer we must prepare a project scope and create a budget. We shall tell you how
                                much of that scope can be completed within the budget and we'll be able to estimate how long will it take
                                after at least a month of work. Don't worry, if you're not happy with our work after two weeks you can retract
                                from the project with no penalties, this is our trial period and we believe that any reliable software house
                                should give you one.

                                After all, we know our work inside out. Of course if you want to maintain the app by yourself the source code
                                and all technical data is at your disposal, but even in that case, feel free to contact us if you need any help.

                                and the coding is complete, we’ll show the website from our server. Once the website is approved, you need to
                                pay the balance 50% to enable us to transfer the website to your server. For projects with high value,
